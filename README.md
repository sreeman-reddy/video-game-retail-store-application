Video Game Retail Store Application

The project implements an online portal for the sale of physical/digital versions of video games for multiple gaming platforms. The project intends to help the end-user keep track of inventory and sales of video games, while having instant access to basic information about the games being sold. The project provides and implements a robust framework for a back-end database and a corresponding front-end application that queries the database. This framework can be developed further by the end-user.

The project provides a database established in MySQL with eight tables containing information about video games, their developers and publishers, their distinct versions; information about the stores, like location, inventory of games in each store, along with the prices and stock; information about the game sales in each store, like date of purchase, quantity purchased, etc. These tables are queried through the front-end application (built using PHP) that is accessed by the administrator and/or manager of each store. Through the front-end application, the admin/manager can add/update publishers, developers, games, platforms, and stores in the database. They can also make an addition or update the inventory of each store or add a new record to the Sales table through a transaction that ensures each sale is secure. Furthermore, they can monitor the stock of different versions of the games available in each store or the revenue generated by each version of a game. The administrator can also delete information of one of the stores altogether if that store were to close permanently.
