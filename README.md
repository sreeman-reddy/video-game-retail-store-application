Video Game Retail Store Application

The aim of the project is to implement an online portal for the sale of physical or digital versions of video games for multiple gaming platforms. The project intends to help the end-user keep track of inventory and sales of video games, and also have instant access to basic information about the games being sold. The project provides and implements a robust framework for a back-end database and a corresponding front end application that queries the database. This framework can be developed further by the end-user.

The project is intended for video game retailers who have multiple stores. By implementing the project, the retailer is able to keep track of the sales activities across its stores, as well as know the inventory status of its stores. Even if the project is primarily geared towards established businesses with multiple stores, it is reliable enough to be implemented by start-up businesses. The aforementioned framework is flexible and can be readily updated and expanded by such businesses as they grow over the years. Furthermore, due to the frameworkâ€™s flexibility, the project can also be implemented by a retailer that intends to do its business exclusively online.

The project provides a database established in MySQL with eight tables containing information about video games, their developers and publishers, their distinct versions; information about the stores, like location, inventory of games in each store along with the prices and stock; information about the game sales in each store, like date of purchase, quantity purchased, etc. These tables are queried through the front-end application that is accessed by the administrator and/or manager of each store. Through the front-end application, the admin/manager can add/update publishers, developers, games, platforms, and stores to the database. They can also make add or update the inventory of each store or add a new record to the Sales table through a transaction that ensures that each sale is secure. Furthermore, they can monitor the stock of different versions of the games available in each store or the revenue generated by each version of a game. The administrator can also delete information of one of the stores altogether if that store were to permanently close.
